# Azure Express Route
---

Azure ExpressRoute is a dedicated, private network connectivity service in Azure that enables you to establish high-speed, secure, and reliable connections between your on-premises infrastructure/data centers and Azure cloud services. Unlike public internet-based connections (e.g., VPN), ExpressRoute uses a dedicated circuit provided by a connectivity partner (e.g., AT\&T, Verizon, Equinix) to bypass the public internet, ensuring lower latency, higher throughput, and enterprise-grade SLAs (up to 99.99% uptime).

## Key Components & Architecture:

1. ExpressRoute Circuit

* A logical connection between your on-premises network and Azure, provisioned through a connectivity provider.  
* Supports bandwidths from 50 Mbps to 100 Gbps (depending on provider/SKU).  
* Can connect to Azure regions globally or leverage ExpressRoute Global Reach to link on-premises sites across regions.

2. Peering Types

* Private Peering: Directly connects to Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). Used for accessing Azure IaaS resources (VMs, storage, etc.).  
* Microsoft Peering: Connects to Microsoft cloud services (e.g., Azure PaaS, Office 365, Dynamics 365). Requires public IP prefixes and BGP configuration.  
* Public Peering (Deprecated): Legacy peering for Azure public services (now replaced by Microsoft Peering).

3. Connectivity Models

* CloudExchange Co-location: Connect via a partner’s Ethernet exchange (e.g., Equinix).  
* Point-to-Point Ethernet: Direct fiber connection from your premises to Azure.  
* Any-to-Any (IPVPN): Integrate with existing MPLS WANs (e.g., via AT\&T NetBond).

4. ExpressRoute Gateways

* Deployed in Azure VNets to route traffic between on-premises and Azure.  
* Supports active-active or active-passive configurations for redundancy.

**How It Works:**

1. Provisioning  
* Work with a connectivity partner to set up an ExpressRoute circuit.  
* Configure BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) to exchange routes between on-premises and Azure.  
2. Traffic Flow  
* On-premises traffic is routed through the dedicated circuit to Azure’s backbone network.  
* Traffic bypasses the public internet, reducing latency and exposure to threats.  
3. Integration with Azure Services  
* Azure VNets: Connect via private peering.  
* Office 365/Microsoft 365: Access via Microsoft Peering (requires compliance validation).  
* Azure Storage/DBs: Use private endpoints for secure access.

**Use Cases:**

1. Mission-Critical Workloads: SAP HANA, SQL Server, and other latency-sensitive applications.  
2. Hybrid Cloud: Extend on-premises data centers to Azure (lift-and-shift or hybrid apps).  
3. Compliance & Security: Meet regulatory requirements (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) with private connectivity.  
4. Multi-Cloud Connectivity: Use ExpressRoute Global Reach to connect Azure with AWS/AWS Direct Connect or Google Cloud.  
5. Office 365 Access: Optimize performance for Microsoft 365 services (e.g., Teams, SharePoint).

## ExpressRoute vs. VPN Gateway:

| Feature | Express Route | VPN Gateway |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Connection Type | Private, dedicated circuit | Encrypted over public internet |
| Speed | 50 Mbps – 100 Gbps | Up to 10 Gbps (Gateway SKU) |
| Latency | Predictable, low | Variable (internet-dependent) |
| SLAs | 99.95%–99.99% | 99.9% (Standard SKU) |
| Cost | Higher (circuit \+ data transfer fees) | Lower (pay-as-you-go) |
| Use Cases | Enterprise-grade, high-throughput needs | Small-scale, cost-sensitive setups |

**Pricing Model:**

1. Circuit Costs  
* Metered: Pay for data egress (outbound traffic from Azure).  
* Unlimited: Fixed monthly fee (unlimited data transfer).  
2. Provider Fees  
* Charges from the connectivity partner for the physical circuit.  
3. ExpressRoute Direct (10/100 Gbps circuits)  
* For large enterprises needing direct control over ports (e.g., bypassing partners).


**Redundancy & High Availability:**

1. Dual Circuits: Deploy circuits in geo-redundant pairs (e.g., East US and West US).  
2. Active-Active Gateways: Use multiple ExpressRoute gateways for failover.  
3. ExpressRoute FastPath: Bypasses the gateway for direct data flow to VNets (supports up to 100 Gbps).

**Security Best Practices:**

1. Encryption: Use MACsec (Layer 2 encryption) for ExpressRoute Direct circuits.  
2. Network Segmentation: Isolate traffic with Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Azure Firewall.  
3. Private Endpoints: Access Azure PaaS (e.g., Storage, SQL DB) privately without public IPs.

**Monitoring & Troubleshooting:**

1. Azure Monitor: Track circuit health, BGP routes, and traffic metrics.  
2. Network Watcher: Diagnose connectivity issues with Connection Monitor and Packet Capture.  
3. ExpressRoute Health: Partner portals (e.g., Equinix Cloud Exchange) provide circuit status.

**Example Architecture:**

\[On-Premises DC\] → \[MPLS Network\] → \[ExpressRoute Circuit\] → \[Azure Region\]    
                                     |    
                                     → \[Private Peering → VNet1\]    
                                     → \[Microsoft Peering → Office 365\]
