# Azure Private Link
---

Azure Private Link is a service that enables secure, private connectivity to Azure services, third-party services, and your own services hosted on Azure. It allows you to access these services over a private endpoint within your Azure Virtual Network (VNet), eliminating exposure to the public internet.

## Key Components:

1. Private Endpoint  
* A network interface in your VNet with a private IP address from your subnet.  
* Acts as the entry point to connect privately to a service (e.g., Azure Storage, SQL DB, or a custom app).  
* Traffic flows over the Azure backbone network (not the public internet).  
2. Private Link Service  
* Lets you expose your own services (e.g., apps running on VMs, AKS, or Azure Load Balancer) privately to other VNets.  
* Consumers connect to your service via their own private endpoints.  
3. Azure Private DNS Zone  
* Automatically maps the service’s DNS name (e.g., mystorage.blob.core.windows.net) to its private IP.  
* Ensures DNS resolution works seamlessly for private connections.

**How It Works:**

1. Create a Private Endpoint in your VNet for the target service (e.g., Azure Storage).  
2. DNS Mapping: Azure updates DNS to resolve the service’s public FQDN to the private IP of the endpoint.  
3. Traffic Flow: Applications connect to the service using its standard domain name, but traffic stays entirely within Azure’s private network.  
4. Security: No public IPs or open ports are required for the service.

**Key Benefits:**

1. Enhanced Security: Eliminates public internet exposure for sensitive services.  
2. Simplified Network Architecture: Access services across regions, VNets, or on-premises via private IPs.  
3. Compliance: Meets data residency and regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).  
4. Cross-Access: Securely share services between Azure tenants or with customers.

**Use Cases:**

* Access Azure PaaS Privately: Connect to Azure Storage, SQL DB, or Cosmos DB without public endpoints.  
* Hybrid Connectivity: On-premises apps (via VPN/ExpressRoute) can access Azure services via private endpoints.  
* Multi-Tenant Services: Securely offer your SaaS solution to customers over Private Link.  
* Third-Party Services: Use Azure Marketplace services (e.g., Snowflake) privately.

**Example Scenario**

Goal: Securely connect an on-premises app to Azure Storage.

* Create a Private Endpoint in your VNet for the storage account.  
* Configure DNS: Ensure mystorage.blob.core.windows.net resolves to the private IP.  
* On-Premises Access: Use ExpressRoute/VPN to connect on-premises networks to the VNet.  
* Result:The on-premises app accesses the storage account via the private endpoint.  
  No public internet traffic; all data stays within Azure’s network.

**Setup Steps:**

1. Create a Private Endpoint:  
* In the Azure portal, navigate to your service (e.g., Storage Account).  
* Under Networking, select Private Endpoint and configure the VNet/subnet.  
2. Integrate with Private DNS:  
* Automatically create a Private DNS Zone (e.g., privatelink.blob.core.windows.net).  
3. Verify Connectivity:  
* Use nslookup to confirm the service’s FQDN resolves to the private IP.  
4. On-Premises Access:  
* Extend DNS resolution to on-premises via conditional forwarding or Azure DNS Resolver.

**Cost:**

* Private Endpoints: Charged hourly (\~$0.01/hour per endpoint).  
* Data Processing: Inbound data is free; outbound data costs apply (\~$0.01/GB).  
* Private DNS Zones: \~$0.50/month per zone.

**Best Practices:**

1. Disable Public Access: For sensitive services, disable public endpoints after enabling Private Link.  
2. Use NSGs: Restrict traffic to private endpoints using Network Security Groups.  
3. Centralized DNS: Use Azure Private DNS Zones for consistent resolution across hybrid networks.  
4. Monitor: Track connections with Azure Monitor and Private Link metrics.

**Common Pitfalls:**

1. DNS Misconfiguration: If DNS isn’t updated, apps may still route traffic over the public internet.  
2. Endpoint Limits: Each subscription has a limit (\~1,000 Private Endpoints).  
3. Service Compatibility: Not all Azure services support Private Link.
