# Service Endpoints And Private Endpoints
---

Azure Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints are two distinct features for securely connecting to Azure services (like Storage, SQL DB, or Key Vault) from your virtual networks (VNets).

## 1\. Service Endpoints

**What They Do:**

* Extend your VNet identity to Azure services over a direct, private connection (bypassing the public internet).  
* Traffic stays within Azure’s backbone network (improved security and latency).  
* Restrict access to the service to only your VNet (via service firewall rules).

**Key Features:**

* No Public Exposure: The service (e.g., a storage account) still has a public endpoint, but access is restricted to your VNet.  
* Subnet-Level Control: Enable service endpoints on specific subnets.  
* Free to Use: No additional cost beyond standard Azure service usage.

**Example:**

* Enable a service endpoint for Azure Storage on subnet 10.0.1.0/24.  
* Configure the storage account’s firewall to allow only traffic from 10.0.1.0/24.  
* Result: VMs in that subnet can access the storage account securely via Azure’s network.


**Use Cases:**

* Secure access to PaaS services (e.g., Storage, SQL DB) from within a VNet.  
* Replace public internet access with a private connection.

## 2\. Private Endpoints

**What They Do:**

* Map a private IP address in your VNet directly to an Azure service instance (e.g., a storage account or SQL DB).  
* Traffic flows entirely over the VNet (no public internet exposure).  
* The service becomes a private resource within your network.

**Key Features:**

* Private IP Address: The service gets a dedicated IP in your VNet (e.g., 10.0.1.5).  
* DNS Integration: Automatically updates DNS to resolve the service name to the private IP.  
* No Public Access: Disable public endpoints for maximum security.

**Example:**

* Create a private endpoint for an Azure SQL Database.  
* The SQL DB gets a private IP (10.0.1.10) in your VNet.  
* Result: Applications in the VNet connect to sqlserver.database.windows.net, which resolves to 10.0.1.10.

**Use Cases:**

* Fully privatize access to Azure services (e.g., for compliance).  
* Access services from on-premises networks over ExpressRoute/VPN.  
* Eliminate exposure to public internet threats.

## Key Differences:

| Feature | Service Endpoint | Private Endpoint |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Connectivity | Connects VNet to service over Azure backbone. | Maps service to a private IP in your VNet. |
| Public Exposure | Service retains a public endpoint | Service can disable public access entirely. |
| IP Address | Uses service’s public IP (traffic stays private). | Assign a private IP from your VNet. |
| Network Scope | Subnet-level. | Resource-level (specific service instance). |
| DNS Resolution | Resolves to public IP (but traffic is private). | Resolves to private IP. |
| Cost | Free. | Charges apply for private endpoints. |

**When to Use Each:**

* Service Endpoints: Use when you want to secure traffic to PaaS services but don’t need to hide the service’s public endpoint. Example: Allow only your VNet to access a storage account, but keep it unaccessible publicly for other uses.  
* Private Endpoints: Use when you need full network isolation (disable public access). Example: A database that should only be reachable internally (e.g., PCI compliance).

**Best Practices:**

* Combine Both: Use service endpoints for VNet-to-service traffic and private endpoints for fully private access.  
* DNS Configuration: For private endpoints, use Azure Private DNS Zones to resolve service names to private IPs.  
* Disable Public Access: For sensitive services, use private endpoints and disable public endpoints entirely.

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**

* Overlapping Rules: Ensure firewall rules (service endpoints) and private endpoints don’t conflict.  
* DNS Misconfiguration: Private endpoints require DNS updates to resolve to private IPs.  
* Ignoring Costs: Private endpoints incur hourly and data processing charges.
